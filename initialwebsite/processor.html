        <p>Currently, the largest two chip manufacturers for desktop CPUs (Central Processing Unit) are AMD and Intel.
            Both companies produce industry-leading CPUs that can clock up to 5 Ghz. The higher its clockspeed, the
            faster it is. However, clockspeed is not the only consideration for a CPU.
            Overclocking is when you boost your CPU's base speed, given that you have avaiable <a href="./power.html">power
                supply</a> wattage as well as manageable CPU temperatures. Cores and threads are important because
            they determine how much work you can do with your CPU.</p>
        <h3>AMD CPUs</h3>
        <p>AMD's current generation of CPUs are the ryzen 5000 lineup, primarily based on the Zen3 architecture. They
            fit into the B550 and X570 <a href="./motherboard.html"> motherboards</a>
            You can find which motherboard your CPU is compatable with through: </p>

        <h3>Intel CPUs</h3>
        <p>Intel's current lineup of CPUs are the 10th generation Core i lineup, containing the i3, i5, i7, and i9, all
            using Intel's new Tiger Lake architecture.

        <p>CPUs also requiere a CPU cooler, so they don't end up killing themselves from the heat they produce, which
            can reach 100 degrees celsius. There are 2 main types of cpu coolers: air cooling and AIOs.
            A CPU air cooler is basically a fan and some fins to help dissapate heat, all put on top of a processor. Air
            coolers are the most basic, as well as the cheapest.
            An AIO (All in One) is a radiator and a cooler put on top of a processor, connected by flexible piping to
            contain water. AIOs are more expensive, but normally cool better than air coolers.</p>
