        <p>To prevent your PC from becoming a fire hazard and to protect the sensitive components inside, it is
            recommended that you get a trustworthy and suitable case. Most cases are made of some type of metal
            like aluminum, and can come with a tempered class sidepanel.
            Just like <a href="./motherboard.html">motherboards</a>, cases have different size standards, which are 
            full tower, mid tower, and mini ITX, from largest to smallest. Smaller cases are usually harder to build in 
            and have much less air ventiliation, however they are much smaller and can be fit in much smaller areas. 
            Larger cases like E-ATX are large and heavy, but support better ventiliation.</p>
        <p>To regulate temperatures inside the case, you need fans. Fans are the cheapest way to cool the parts of your
            system.
