    <p> The motherboard is a piece of plastic that houses other major parts of the computer, such as the processor,
        memory, storage, etc.</p>

    <p>To the right is an image of an MSI B550 motherboard. The square in the upper middle, called the CPU socket, would
        contain
        the <a href="./processor.html">processor</a>. Different sockets fit different processors. Some
        boards, such as this one, are designed for AMD processors, while others are designed with Intel processors
        in mind. The vertical slits to its right contain the <a href="./memorystorage.html">memory sticks</a>. The
        two horizantal rectangular grey pieces below the processor are heatsinks for <a href="./memorystorage.html">M.2
        storage SSDs</a>. The long horizantal slits below the processor are PCIe slots for the <a href="./graphics.html">graphics 
        cards</a>. The large covered area at the top right of the board contains the ports of the motherboard, in order to 
        allow it to power other devices connected to the computer via USB ports and similar ports.</p>
    <p>Processors can cost hundreds of dollars. Higher-quality motherboards tend to offer more features, such as built in wifi, 
        better asthetics, and are more durable. In addition, there are different sizes of motherboards. The main 4 sizes are: micro ATX, 
        mini ATX, standard ATX and E-ATX, from smallest to largest.
