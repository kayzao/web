    <h1>About the Project:</h1>
    <h2>What is the python program called and what does it do?</h2>
    <p>The program, called <strong><i>Typewriter</i></strong>, takes in a text file containing a book from <a href=https://www.gutenberg.org target="_blank">Project 
        Gutenburg</a>, as well as some user input, to print out randomly generated words for the user to type, with 
        most punctuation removed. The program then calculates the time taken for the user to finish typing,
        which words were incorrect, and which characters were incorrect. With this information, it is able to tell the
        user their WPM (words per minute), number of characters typed, accuracy of characters typed, accuracy of each character, 
        and which words were typed incorrectly.</p>
    <h2>How does the program print randomly generated words?</h2>
    <p>The text file with the book has already been edited to not have the table of contents and the header and footer.
        First, the text file is split into words, and added into a list. Then, a random number is generated from 0 to
        the length of the list minus one. The random number picks a word in the list, and if the word doesn't contain
        numbers, the word is added to a seperate string. Once the requested number of words is generated, the program runs 
        through the list, removing all characters if they are not letters or dashes. Finally, the words are printed.</p>
    <h2>How does it calculate WPM and other related characteristics?</h2>
    <p>The time taken for the user to type the words is calculated by saving the time when the user is prompted to start
        typing, and subtracts that from the time at when the user presses enter.</p>
    <p>WPM is calculated by dividing the number of characters inputed by the number of seconds it took to do so, before
        dividing the result by 4.7, since 4.7 characters is a rough estimate for the average word length in English.</p>
    <p>To find out which words were typed incorrectly, both the user's input and the printed words are split into
        seperate lists containing their words. The program then compares each word to its corresponding word in the
        user's input, and if they do not match, then it is marked as a "wrong word".</p>
    <p>To find out whcih characters were mistakes and which ones were correct, <strong><i>Typewriter</i></strong> looks at each character of each 
        word from the answer and from the output. It goes through all the letters of a word in the answer, or in the 
        output, depending on which one is shorter. If one of these letters is incorrect, the program marks it as such. 
        If not, the program marks it as correct. Next, if the word from the answer is too long, the program counts the number 
        of extra letters, and marks the last letter of the word from the output wrong that many times. If the word from the 
        answer is too short, then it marks each letter of the output word that hasn't been compared yet as a mistake.</p>
    <p>To find the accuracy of each letter typed, <strong><i>Typewriter</i></strong> simply prints out the number of times a character was typed correctly
        divided by the total number of times that character was typed, and converts it to a percentage.</p>
