        <p>There are two types of graphics cards: dedicated and integrated graphics. Integrated graphics are the
            graphics integrated with some processors, and are almost always slower than dedicated graphics.
            Dedicated graphics are separate from the processor, as they require their own housing, cooling, etc.
            AMD has a graphics lineup called Radeon RX. Their newest GPUS include the RX 6900 XT, 6800 XT, and 6800.
            These gpus support ray tracing.</p>

        <p>Nvidia has a graphics lineup called RTX, which means "ray-tracing", a technique used in games and in renders
            to make light sources seem more realistic. Their newest GPUs include the RTX 3090, RTX 3080, RTX 3070, RTX
            3060 Ti, and RTX 3060.</p>

            alt="NVIDIA GPU" class="border" width="500" height="300">
        <p>Nvidia GPUs have much better drivers than AMD. Nvidia has new software that allows for gaming resolution
            upscaling, and their gpus themselves are better thought out for ray tracing. AMD gpus, however, usually give
            more performance for their price, up to the previous generation. It remains to be seen if the new generation
            of gpus follow that trend.</p>
