        <h1>Memory</h1>
        <p>RAM, or Random access Memory, is what the CPU uses to save data quickly. Desktop RAM can be categorized by
            the letters DDR, followed by a number, with that number representing the generation of that memory. The
            current, and most widely used, generation of RAM is DDR4. It supports speeds of up to 3600mhz.
            Different <a href="./processor.html">CPUs</a> support different amounts of RAM. Usually, you would want at least
            4gb of RAM if you want to run Windows. If you want to play games, then it is recommended to have 8-16gb of
            RAM. For memory intensive workloads should have at least 32gb of RAM</p>

        <p>On your motherboard, you should have at least 2 slots of RAM for peak performance.

                href="https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/memory-buying-guide,6347.html" target="_blank">here</a> for a guide on the
            specifics of memory</p>
        <p>There is a difference between memory and storage. Memory is volatile, meaning that it resets if power is
            lost. Storage, on the other hand, is permanent, as long as the item holding the data is not physically
            destroyed. There are two primary types of storage: Hard drives and SSDs.</p>
        <p>SSD stands for Solid State Drives, and they are the faster, but more expensive, storage option of the two.
            There are several types of SSDs, but all are faster, and more reliable than hard drives. They function by
            electronically saving data.</p>
        <p>Hard drives are much cheaper than SSDs, but are less reliable, and take up more space. This is because unlike
            SSDs, hard drives save data on discs, and physically locate data.</p>
