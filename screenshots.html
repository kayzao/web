    <h2>A video of the program running:</h2>

    <p><strong><i>Typewriter</i></strong> interacts with the user through the terminal, and each time it prompts the user, it uses
         ">>> " to indicate that it can accept an input. Most of the text printed is printed with a small delay between each character. 
        This is to give the user time to read what the program is printing out without having the program print out large chunks of text at
        once. The program starts by asking the user how many words they want to type. If the returned input is a number greater than 
        0, the program will proceed to print that many numbers. Otherwise, it will print the default of sixty words. Once the words 
        are printed, the user is prompted to type. When the user inputs their string, the program compares it to the string it outputted,
        and tells the reader the amount oof time they took, how many characters they typed per second, their WPM, if they answered 
        correctly or not, their mistyped words if they have any, and their accuracy. Finally, it will ask the user if they want to see a 
        chart of how accurate they typed each character in the english alphabet. If the user enters "y", a graph will appear showing 
        the percentages of how accurate they typed a character. If the user typed "n", the program will end, and until the user does either
        of those two things, they will be repeatedly prompted to enter either "y" for yes or "n" for no.
