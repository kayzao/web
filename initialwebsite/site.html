        <h2>Motherboard</h2>
        <p> The motherboard is a piece of plastic that houses other major parts of the computer, such as the processor,
            memory, storage, etc.</p>

        <p>Above is an image of an MSI B550 motherboard. The square in the upper middle would contain
            the <a href="#processor">processor</a>. Different processors can fit different types of processors. Some
            boards, such as this one, are designed for AMD processors, while others are designed with Intel processors
            in mind. The vertical slits to its right contain the <a href="#memorystorage">memory sticks</a>. The
            two horizantal rectangular grey pieces below the processor are heatsinks for <a
                href="#memorystorage">M.2storage SSDs</a>.
            The long horizantal slits below the processor are PCIe slots for the <a href="#graphics">graphics
                cards</a>. The large covered area at the top right of the board contains the ports of the
            motherboard, in order to allow it to power other devices connected to the computer via USB ports and similar
            ports.</p>

        <h2>Power Supply</h2>
        <p>The power supply is a crucial part of any computer, since it provides the only way for a computer to recieve
            electricity. Power supplies are rates based on how many watts they can provide, and how efficient they are.
            For
            example, given a power supply named CX500M 80+ Bronze, its efficiency is at minimum above 80%, so if it is
            providing 500 watts, it is drawing a maximum of 625 watts from the wall. Bronze is an additional
            categorization, with Bronze being the least efficient 80+ PSU, followed by silver, gold, platinum and
            finally, titanium. The more efficient, the less electricity is being wasted.</p>

        <h2>Processor</h2>
        <img src="https://www.techspot.com/articles-info/2000/images/2020-04-06-image-9.jpg" alt="CPU image" width="500"
            height="300">
        <p>Currently, the largest two chip manufacturers for desktop CPUs (Central Processing Unit) are AMD and Intel.
            Both companies produce industry-leading CPUs that can clock up to 5 Ghz. The higher its clockspeed, the
            faster it is. However, clockspeed is not the only consideration for a CPU.
            Overclocking is when you boost your CPU's base speed, given that you have avaiable <a href="power">power
                supply</a> wattage as well as manageable CPU temperatures. Cores and threads are important because
            they determine how much work you can do with your CPU.</p>
        <h4>AMD CPUs</h4>
        <p>AMD's current generation of CPUs are the ryzen 5000 lineup, primarily based on the Zen3 architecture. They
            fit into the B550 and X570 <a href="#motherboard"> motherboards</a>
            You can find which motherboard your CPU is compatable with through: </p>

            width="500" height="300">
        <h4>Intel CPUs</h4>
        <p>Intel's current lineup of CPUs are the 10th generation Core i lineup, containing the i3, i5, i7, and i9, all
            using Intel's new Tiger Lake architecture.
        <p>For more information on Intel processors, click <a

        </p>
        <p>CPUs also requiere a CPU cooler, so they don't end up killing themselves from the heat they produce, which
            can reach 100 degrees celsius. There are 2 main types of cpu coolers: air cooling and AIOs.
            A CPU air cooler is basically a fan and some fins to help dissapate heat, all put on top of a processor. Air
            coolers are the most basic, as well as the cheapest.
            An AIO (All in One) is a radiator and a cooler put on top of a processor, connected by flexible piping to
            contain water. AIOs are more expensive, but normally cool better than air coolers.</p>

        <h2>Memory</h2>
        <p>RAM, or Random access Memory, is what the CPU uses to save data quickly. Desktop RAM can be categorized by
            the letters DDR, followed by a number, with that number representing the generation of that memory. The
            current, and most widely used, generation of RAM is DDR4. It supports speeds of up to 3600mhz.
            Different <a href="#processor">CPUs</a> support different amounts of RAM. Usually, you would want at least
            4gb of RAM if you want to run Windows. If you want to play games, then it is recommended to have 8-16gb of
            RAM. For memory intensive workloads should have at least 32gb of RAM</p>

            width="500" height="300">
        <p>On your motherboard, you should have at least 2 slots of RAM for peak performance.

                href="https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/memory-buying-guide,6347.html" target="_blank">here</a> for a guide on the
            specifics of memory</p>
        <p>There is a difference between memory and storage. Memory is volatile, meaning that it resets if power is
            lost. Storage, on the other hand, is permanent, as long as the item holding the data is not physically
            destroyed. There are two primary types of storage: Hard drives and SSDs.</p>
        <p>SSD stands for Solid State Drives, and they are the faster, but more expensive, storage option of the two.
            There are several types of SSDs, but all are faster, and more reliable than hard drives. They function by
            electronically saving data.</p>
        <p>Hard drives are much cheaper than SSDs, but are less reliable, and take up more space. This is because unlike
            SSDs, hard drives save data on discs, and physically locate data.</p>

    <div id="graphics">
        <h2>Graphics</h2>
        <p>There are two types of graphics cards: dedicated and integrated graphics. Integrated graphics are the
            graphics integrated with some processors, and are almost always slower than dedicated graphics.
            Dedicated graphics are separate from the processor, as they requiere their own housing, cooling, etc.
            AMD has a graphics lineup called Radeon RX. Their newest GPUS include the RX 6900 XT, 6800 XT, and 6800.
            These gpus support ray tracing.</p>

            height="300">
        <p>Nvidia has a graphics lineup called RTX, which means "ray-tracing", a technique used in games and in renders
            to make light sources seem more realistic. Their newest GPUs include the rtx 3090, rtx 3080, rtx 3070, rtx
            3060 ti, and rtx 3060.</p>

            alt="NVIDIA GPU" width="500" height="300">
        <p>Nvidia GPUs have much better drivers than AMD. Nvidia has new software that allows for gaming resolution
            upscaling, and their gpus themselves are better thought out for ray tracing.</p>

        <h2>Computer Case</h2>
        <img src="https://www.adorama.com/images/300x300/lipco11dw.jpg" alt="Computer Case">
        <p>To prevent your PC from becoming a fire hazard and to protect the sensitive components inside, it is
            recommended that you get a trustworthy and suitable case. Most cases are made of some type of metal
            like aluminum, and can come with a tempered class sidepanel.
            Just like <a href="#motherboard">motherboards</a>, cases have different size standards. These include E-ATX,
            ATX, micro ATX, and mini ITX. Smaller cases are usually harder to build in and have much less air
            ventiliation, however they are much smaller and can be fit in much smaller areas. Larger cases like E-ATX
            are large and heavy, but support better ventiliation.</p>
        <p>To regulate temperatures inside the case, you need fans. Fans are the cheapest way to cool the parts of your
            system.
